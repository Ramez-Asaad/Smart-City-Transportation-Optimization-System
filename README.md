✅ Deliverables Overview
1. 🧠 Implementation of Dynamic Programming Solutions for Scheduling
We used dynamic programming (DP) to optimize the allocation of buses and metro trains based on travel demand data.

✔ Key Highlights:
Demand-weighted allocation of units (buses or trains) to routes.

Objective: Maximize total served passengers.

Constraints: Fixed total number of buses/trains (e.g. 200 buses, 30 metro trains).

Backtracking approach to trace optimal resource distribution.

Demand between every pair of stops/stations was used to compute utility (benefit).

📁 Implemented Files:
dp_schedule.py: Contains all DP functions including:

optimize_schedule_dp()

generate_optimized_schedule()

build_demand_matrix()

3. 📈 Analysis of Improvements in Coverage and Travel Times
📊 Before Optimization:
Manual/static allocation of buses/metros.

Uneven demand coverage.

Overcrowded or underutilized routes.

📊 After Optimization:
DP maximized demand satisfaction.

Fairer distribution of transport units across busy routes.

Estimated intervals (min/bus or min/train) decreased on high-demand routes.

🚍 Key Metrics:
Average interval per route (before vs after)

% increase in passenger coverage

Distribution of buses/trains optimized using demand weights

4. 📝 Documentation of Approach and Implementation
Sections to Include:
Problem Statement: Optimize public transport coverage and efficiency using data-driven techniques.

Data Used: List files (bus_routes.json, metro_lines.json, public_transportation_demand.csv, etc.).

Techniques Applied:

Dynamic Programming for scheduling

Graph modeling of the transportation network

Transfer point analysis

Challenges Faced: Data inconsistencies (e.g., extra whitespace), estimating intervals, choosing benefit functions.

Future Work:

Add time-of-day dynamic scheduling

Incorporate traffic congestion in route weighting

Integrate user feedback or real-time updates
