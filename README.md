Public Transit Optimization System Documentation
System Architecture and Design Decisions
Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular architecture with these key components:

Data Layer: Handles input data processing (bus routes, metro lines, demand data)

Network Modeling: Constructs a multimodal transportation graph

Optimization Engine: Contains algorithms for transfer point optimization and resource allocation

Scheduling Module: Generates timetables based on optimization results

Visualization Interface: Provides interactive network maps and results display

Key Design Decisions
Multimodal Network Representation:

Uses NetworkX graph structure to model both bus and metro systems

Edges contain metadata about route type, capacity, and identifiers

Nodes represent physical stops/stations

Optimization Approach:

Hybrid optimization combining:

Scoring system for transfer points

Dynamic programming for resource allocation

Constraint-based scheduling

Performance Considerations:

Pre-computes demand and connectivity metrics

Uses simplified DP when exact solution is computationally expensive

Implements diminishing returns for vehicle allocation

Algorithm Implementations and Modifications
1. Transfer Point Optimization Algorithm
Implementation:
def optimize_transfer_points(self):
    transfer_scores = []
    for point in self.transfer_points:
        # Calculate connectivity score
        degree = self.network.degree(point)
        
        # Calculate demand score
        demand_in = sum(self.demand_data.get((src, point), 0) for src in self.network.nodes())
        demand_out = sum(self.demand_data.get((point, dest), 0) for dest in self.network.nodes())
        
        # Calculate transfer efficiency
        transfer_efficiency = 0
        neighbors = list(self.network.neighbors(point))
        for i in range(len(neighbors)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(neighbors)):
                if self.network[point][neighbors[i]]['type'] != self.network[point][neighbors[j]]['type']:
                    transfer_efficiency += 1
        
        score = 0.4*(degree) + 0.3*(demand_in + demand_out)/1000 + 0.3*transfer_efficiency
        transfer_scores.append((point, score))

Modifications:

Added transfer efficiency metric to prioritize points with more intermodal connections

Used weighted scoring to balance connectivity and demand

Normalized demand values to prevent dominance by any single factor

2. Resource Allocation Algorithm
Implementation:
def _dp_allocate(self, values, max_units, min_units, max_per_route):
    n = len(values)
    dp = [[0] * (max_units + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        route_id, value = values[i-1]
        for u in range(max_units + 1):
            max_possible = min(u, max_per_route)
            for alloc in range(min_units, max_possible + 1):
                current_value = value * min(alloc, 10)  # Diminishing returns
                if dp[i-1][u-alloc] + current_value > dp[i][u]:
                    dp[i][u] = dp[i-1][u-alloc] + current_value


Modifications:

Added constraints for minimum/maximum vehicles per route

Implemented diminishing returns (capped at 10 vehicles)

Simplified DP table to handle larger problem sizes

Added backtracking to reconstruct allocation
